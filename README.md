# Bingo

This code was built from scratch following along with the course [Building Web Apps with Elm](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/elm) from Pragmatic Studio (highly recommended).

This repo may help others taking this course as I needed to make some updates to work with the latest packages.

Adding [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is an optional step (it just works so well in Elm projects).

## Updates

- `elm 0.19.0` (from `0.18.0`)
- `elm/http 2.0.0` (from `1.0.0`)
- `parcel 1.12.3` (from `elm-live`)
- all exercises

To start your app:

- start the JSON server from the code bundle
- `npm start` from the `bingo` directory

Now you can visit [`localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234) from your browser.
